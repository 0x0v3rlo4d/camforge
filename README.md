# üé• CamForge

**CamForge** is an experimental, cross-platform, open-source camera input processor for enabling custom filters and homebrew shaders, for your media needs.

It lets you brew your own real-time filters, shaders, and visual hacks using OpenGL + GLSL ‚Äî before the feed hits OBS, Zoom, Google Meet, or wherever.

Think: camera-as-canvas.

## üß† Why

Because your webcam shouldn't be boring.

This project is for streamers, artists, VJs, devs, or anyone who wants to intercept a webcam feed, manipulate it with code (or shaders), and stream it onward.

## üèóÔ∏è What It Does (Eventually)

- [ ] Capture webcam input
- [ ] Render it in an OpenGL Context
- [ ] Applly custom GLSL shaders
- [ ] Live-reload shader files
- [ ] Output to virtual webcam (ability to pipe output to OBS, Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
- [ ] GUI frontend for shader/filter management
- [ ] Cross-platform builds (currently Windows first, next Linux-MacOS)
